## Usage 🚀

### Basic Arithmetic
```javascript
import { add, subtract, multiply, divide } from "safebase";

console.log(add("10000000000000000000000", "0.00000000005"));
// '10000000000000000000000.00000000005'

console.log(subtract("-9999999999999999999999.9", "0.1"));
// '-10000000000000000000000'

console.log(multiply("123456789123456789", "0.000000001"));
// '123456789.123456789'

console.log(divide("1000000000000000000000", "0.1"));
// '10000000000000000000000'
```

### Advanced Operations
```javascript
import { 
  compare, min, max, floor, ceil, round, 
  pow, sqrt, nthRoot, mod, gcd, lcm, factorial 
} from "safebase";

// Comparison operations
console.log(compare("123.456", "123.457")); // -1 (less than)
console.log(min("999999999999999999999", "1000000000000000000000")); // '999999999999999999999'
console.log(max("5.67", "5.68", "5.69")); // '5.69'

// Rounding operations
console.log(floor("5.99")); // '5'
console.log(ceil("5.01")); // '6'
console.log(round("5.5")); // '6'

// Power operations
console.log(pow("2", "100")); // '1267650600228229401496703205376'
console.log(sqrt("2")); // '1.41421356237309504880'
console.log(nthRoot("27", "3")); // '3'

// Modular arithmetic
console.log(mod("17", "5")); // '2'
console.log(gcd("48", "18")); // '6'
console.log(lcm("12", "18")); // '36'

// Factorial and combinatorics
console.log(factorial("10")); // '3628800'
```

## API 📚

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

#### `add(left: string, right: string): string`
Adds two numbers represented as strings.

#### `subtract(left: string, right: string): string`
Subtracts the second number from the first, both represented as strings.

#### `multiply(left: string, right: string): string`
Multiplies two numbers represented as strings.

#### `divide(left: string, right: string, precision: number = 20): string`
Divides the first number by the second, both represented as strings. The `precision` parameter determines the number of decimal places in the result (default is 20).

#### `abs(num: string): string`
Returns the absolute value of a number.

### Comparison Operations

#### `compare(a: string, b: string): number`
Compares two numbers. Returns:
- `1` if a > b
- `-1` if a < b  
- `0` if a == b

#### `isEqual(a: string, b: string): boolean`
Checks if two numbers are equal.

#### `isGreaterThan(a: string, b: string): boolean`
Checks if the first number is greater than the second.

#### `isLessThan(a: string, b: string): boolean`
Checks if the first number is less than the second.

#### `min(a: string, b: string, ...rest: string[]): string`
Returns the smallest number from the given arguments.

#### `max(a: string, b: string, ...rest: string[]): string`
Returns the largest number from the given arguments.

### Rounding Operations

#### `floor(num: string): string`
Rounds down to the nearest integer (towards negative infinity).

#### `ceil(num: string): string`
Rounds up to the nearest integer (towards positive infinity).

#### `round(num: string): string`
Rounds to the nearest integer using "round half up" strategy.

#### `truncate(num: string): string`
Removes the fractional part (rounds towards zero).

#### `roundToPrecision(num: string, precision: number): string`
Rounds to the specified number of decimal places.

### Power Operations

#### `pow(base: string, exponent: string): string`
Raises a number to an integer power. Supports negative exponents.

#### `sqrt(num: string, precision: number = 20): string`
Calculates the square root of a number using Newton's method.

#### `nthRoot(radicand: string, n: string, precision: number = 20): string`
Calculates the nth root of a number. The `n` parameter must be a positive integer.

### Modular Arithmetic

#### `mod(dividend: string, divisor: string): string`
Mathematical modulo operation. The result always has the same sign as the divisor.

#### `remainder(dividend: string, divisor: string): string`
Programming remainder operation. The result has the same sign as the dividend.

#### `gcd(a: string, b: string): string`
Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.

#### `lcm(a: string, b: string): string`
Calculates the Least Common Multiple using the formula: lcm(a,b) = |a×b| / gcd(a,b).

### Factorial and Combinatorics

#### `factorial(n: string): string`
Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer (n!).

#### `combination(n: string, r: string): string`
Calculates the number of ways to choose r items from n items (nCr).

#### `permutation(n: string, r: string): string`
Calculates the number of ways to arrange r items from n items (nPr).

## Why SafeBase? 🤔

JavaScript's native number type has limitations when dealing with very large numbers or high precision decimals. SafeBase overcomes these limitations by:

- 🔢 Representing numbers as strings, allowing for arbitrary-length integers
- 🎯 Providing high-precision decimal arithmetic
- 🐛 Avoiding floating-point errors common in JavaScript's native math operations

## Performance 🚀

SafeBase is optimized for performance while maintaining accuracy. It's suitable for applications requiring precise calculations with large numbers, such as financial systems, scientific computing, or cryptography.
